# Testing numerical noun phrases in the inference paradigm

This is a repository for data and code from the experiment described in *The role of Alternatives in the interpretation of scalars and numbers â€“ insights from the inference task.

This repository is organised into two folders, `data/` which contains the full list of items and the raw data used in the analysis, and `analyses/` which contains R code which runs statistical models and generates figures.

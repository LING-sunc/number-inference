# Testing numerical noun phrases in the inference paradigm

This is a repository for data and code from the experiment described in *The role of Alternatives in the interpretation of scalars and numbers â€“ insights from the inference task*.

This repository is organised into three folders, `data/` contains the full list of items and the raw data used in the analysis, `analyses/` contains R code which runs statistical models and generates figures, and `follow up/` contains results from a follow up study in which the partitive form was used for NNPs.

Results from a preliminary pilot study were reported in *ELM1_paper_23.pdf*.
